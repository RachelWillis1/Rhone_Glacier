## Create docker image for this example:
- It is expected that you have Docker installed on your machine
- Download all the folders/files from this_github_repo/Docker/ to one of your empty workfolder and keep there structure:
   - app/
      - scripts-main/
      - pip_list_install.txt
      - sharedfolder/ # Note that you have to create this empty folder before you build the image. This folder will be a shared folder between container and host
   - Dockerfile

- T: yourworkfolder: docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t yourtag .
- T: yourworkfolder: docker images <br>
